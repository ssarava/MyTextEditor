## MyTextEditor

This project was inspired by [RyiSnow's](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow/featured) notepad [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZyZ31nrL2U&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUTPONMeQcEEdKax0wGsnZB).

The editor's basic components mimic that of the original implementation; however, I added functionality in accordance with what I saw observed from common text editors such as NotePad, TextEdit, and Visual Studio Code.
